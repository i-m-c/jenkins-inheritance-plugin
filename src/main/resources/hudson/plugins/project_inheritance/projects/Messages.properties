InheritanceProject.Description=This should be chosen for all tasks that run real \
	commands on build nodes.\n\
	Such projects allow properties to be inherited between each other. \
	This allows the definition of "parent" projects, that have generic \
	settings. Other, more specific, child tasks can then inherit these settings \
	without having to re-define them from scratch.
