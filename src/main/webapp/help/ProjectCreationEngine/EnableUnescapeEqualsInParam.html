		If you set this flag, "Inheritable Parameters" will automatically un-escape
		"%xx" substrings into their respective 8-bit char; where xx is a
		hexadecimal number. The translation will use UTF-16 for the unencoded
		bytes and CP-1252 / ISO-8859-1 for the encoded bytes.

		This is necessary, because the Jenkins CLI can't handle assignment of
		the "=" character properly and truncates at the first such char.
