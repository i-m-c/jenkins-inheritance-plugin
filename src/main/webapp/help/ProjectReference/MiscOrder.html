<div>
This selects the order of precedence of the properties not covered by any of
the above selectors. This means for example the order of exploration for
"Source Code Managers". If this is positive (&ge;0), the settings of the parent
project will take priority over those from the inheriting project.
Otherwise, the inheriting project overwrites (or comes after) the parent
settings.
